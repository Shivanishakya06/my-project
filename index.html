    <p class="shivani">About 2:35 a.m on 30 July 2012, the Northern Region Grid, which provides power to nine states in northern India including Delhi, experienced a widespread outage due to a grid disturbance. Power Grid and POSOCO began work immediately to restore power. By 8:00 a.m. essential services had been restored, with 60 percent of the normal Northern Region Grid load restored by 11:00 a.m. Power supply was then restored progressively and by 12:30 p.m. power was extended to most of the cities and towns through Power Grid substations. The Northern Region Grid was brought back to normalcy to meet the demand of about 30 GW at 7:00 p.m.
